# How to use

## Species selection

You can restrict available choices using **taxonRank** and **kingdom** inputs. You can use multiple taxonRanks type at the same time but only one kingdom at a time. 

Then you can select up to three species using scientificName or vernacularName inputs

## Occurence filtering

Depending on the selected species the sidebar filters will automatically update with available filtering values. You can use these filters to keep only the observation you are interested in. 

## Occurence observations

Once you are happy with your timeline you can click on a specific timeline occurence. If associated pictures are associated with it you will be able to see them in the pictures view. 

The leaflet map will be colored by species. Automatic centering on, and coloration of the selected observation still has to be developed. 

## Count observations (Not developped yet)

You can switch to **Count** panel to see different metrics, numbers and graphs about your selected observations. 

## Countributors (Not developped yet)

The panel to add new observations and explore countributors data still has to be developped.
