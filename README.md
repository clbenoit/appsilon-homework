# Biodata Discovery Board App

This app is built with [Rhino](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino).
You can see a deployed version here: 
[Biodata Discovery Board App Demo](https://omicsverse.fr/app/appsilon-homework).
Using the biodiversity data coming from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=8a863029-f435-446a-821e-275f4f641165&month=1), this Shiny app visualizes observed species on the map, draw a timeline with selected species observation, and allows the user to explore associated pictures.
